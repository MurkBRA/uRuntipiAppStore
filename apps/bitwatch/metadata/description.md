> Monitor Bitcoin addresses in real-time

Monitor Bitcoin addresses in the mempool and on-chain using the mempool.space API and websocket.

Track balance changes, get telegram notifications, and manage expectations for multiple addresses.

Features:
  - Build list of addresses in collections to sum-up balances accross wallets
  - Subscribes to mempool.space (or locally hosted) websocket for real-time mempool activity
  - Double checks data against mempool.space (or locally hosted) API on a configured interval
  - Track both on-chain and mempool activity
  - Configure auto-acceptance or alert mode of changes (chain_in, chain_out, mempool_in, mempool_out)
    - by default, all activity is alerted (new installs); switch directions to auto-accept as needed
    - alerted changes are sent to telegram once and wait for acceptance; auto-accepted changes update silently
  - Route telegram alerts to different chats per collection or address
  - Manage Bitwatch from telegram with bot commands (status, accept, add address, backup)
  - Option to use your own local node for privacy


Recommended to have Mempool + Fulcrum to run privately but not required.
