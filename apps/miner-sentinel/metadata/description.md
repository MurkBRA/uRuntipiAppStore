# MinerSentinel

> Multi-make Bitcoin mining monitor for home ASIC fleets

MinerSentinel is a self-hosted monitoring solution for Bitcoin home miners. It unifies Bitaxe, Avalon, NMAxe, NerdNOS, and other makes into one device registry and dashboard for fleet performance, hardware health, pool stats, cost analysis, Activity alerts, and per-device Controls—with all data stored locally.

**Real-Time Device Monitoring**
Monitor hashrate, temperature, power consumption, and efficiency (J/TH) for each device. Visual status indicators show online, stale, offline, and inactive state.

**Unified Multi-Make Fleet**
Add miners of any supported make through a single Settings registry without restarting services. One detail view covers mining stats, hardware logs, system information, and Controls per device.

**Pool Integration**
Native support for CKPool, Public Pool, BTC PoW Lab, and Parasite Pool solo mining statistics. Track best shares, workers, and pool-side hashrate, plus solo-mining probability estimates.

**Analytics and Cost Analysis**
Interactive charts for hashrate and hardware trends over selectable time ranges. Configure energy rate and currency to estimate power cost; optional revenue-style stats use cached network data.

**Activity, Controls, and Alerts**
In-app Activity journal plus Telegram, Discord, ntfy, Gotify, or webhook notifications for offline devices, hashrate stagnation, new best difficulty, and more. Remote Controls for reboot, fans, and make-specific presets; LAN discovery to find miners on your network.

**Built for Self-Sovereignty**
Runs entirely on your own hardware. All metrics stay in your PostgreSQL database. Packaged for Umbrel with multi-architecture Docker images.
